# Dataset: digital-agenda-indicators (development version)

The dataset of [EU Digital Agenda Key Indicators](https://digital-agenda-data.eu/datasets/digital_agenda_scoreboard_key_indicators) contains statistical information about the European information society. The dataset is composed of a series of statistical observations with various properties and a very regular structure.

This is a large, typical dataset with statistical information, with a very regular structure. In contrast to [linked-spending](https://w3id.org/riverbench/datasets/linked-spending/dev), this dataset does not include textual information and is more homogenous, making it an interesting comparison point for aggressive compression algorithms.

*This README is a snapshot of documentation for the latest development version of the dataset.
Full documentation for all versions can be found [on the website](https://w3id.org/riverbench/datasets/digital-agenda-indicators/dev).*

The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.

    - **Type**: <abbr title="Class for instances of using an RDF stream type, in a program, an academic paper, or elsewhere. This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.  Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.  Note that 'stream type usage' is a subjective assertion and instances of this class may be annotated with additional provenance properties to explain who made the assertion. There can be multiple views on what type of stream is in use, depending on the involved actor, processing step, etc.">RDF stream type usage</abbr> ([stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage](https://w3id.org/stax/ontology#RdfStreamTypeUsage))
